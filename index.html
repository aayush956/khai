     Stay away from the people I told you okay? Stay safe. Keep them blocked. Especially tyo jan. (effect wa ashray vanne k k xa).Just keeping you safe hai from those animals :)
      
      Way beyond asking for forgiveness. Even God might not forgive us. But maybe the ones you hurt can forgive you by some chance, or is it not? I'm only worried about how you will go through anything in the future alone. I hope you'll have your friends by your side, no matter how hard they'll insult me or tell me bad things. Stay strong and be close to them, okay? People don't stop chasing when the beauty is gone; people see that they're no longer good for each other with no future. And instead of hurting them, they choose to be away from them. Because they feel that leaving is what will give them freedom, that will be their stop to their suffering. Even if they suffer now, at least they won't have to later on even more. They are free from expecting things to change. They think that it would be so different if they were of the same kind. Or one allowed the other to stay the same and accept the way they are. Surely, lying did cause a great break in their heart, and that great mistake can never be changed now. They want you to eat well, be healthy, and never stop having faith. Most importantly, never stop being a good person no matter how shitty the world is. Never engage in negativity and bad company. Remember that even if they seemed quiet when you left them, like you were nothing, they knew what was best for you. They won't defend themselves anymore or care how you view them; they will surely carry a burden in their heart, but from the other side, they'll be happy that their loved one won't have to suffer any more in the future. Learn to be happy and prioritize your mental health; stay strong and take good care of your family, especially your mother and father. Reach out to your friends, talk to them; not all of them are fake or untrustworthy. Accomplish your dreams and never stop working hard. Remember, constant practice and training can bring you out as the best, always. Never be lazy; work and give everything you have. Maybe in the future you'll find your same kind, and remember. Once God gives you signs that they're the one, love them the same way you loved before. In the future when you have no one, the old one will still be there if you have things to share to clear your mind. The old one will forever carry one guilt and shame for doing someone wrong. They can only ask for forgiveness. It is you who'll decide to view how bad or evil the old one is for causing you such harm. And maybe your friends will have an influence too. You know the old one very well, their nature and their responsibility. Take care, and at last, I love you. I always did, and I'll never forget you. 
Here, Ritika, I'm updating this page one more time. Please take responsibilities wisely, Hai. Never let ego and arrogance rule over you. Maybe you'll find someone better than me one day, surely. Please love him like you loved me. No, but love him even more. If you need any money or any help, remember I'm there for you, okay? 

Most importantly, don't let the guys fool you, okay? Be wise and smart; don't let them use you for your body. The world is even worse. Remember to stay safe and don't walk around much at night. Visa lagyo vane xai vana hai. After you become a nurse, remember me, okay? I'll be happier for you than anyone else. And btw, don't worry, I won't trouble you at that time. But do what you love, okay? Tmlai jhe mann parxa tyo gara. I feel ashamed of myself for doing such things to you, and now I can't be at the airport when you leave this country.

Ritika, stay safe, okay? Remember, if you need me, I'll be there. And one more thing, don't worry, I won't be a problem to you in your future relationship. Another thing is, keep learning; never stop. 
The second important thing is please don't lose faith and always be close to God. REMEMBER! Read the Bible and pray every single day. And don't worry about the shit that goes on throughout the house; life will get hard as you grow, but learn to be mentally strong. The last advice I'll give for this is to use ChatGPT, okay? Bujheu ni? You can even ask him anything. e.g., you asked about how to be mentally strong. He'll give you the answers. If you don't get it, ask him again to make that one specific topic easier and more understandable. And he'll give it to you.

When you're in trouble or deep pain, remember your friends; they're always there for you. Hritika, Sunil, Soumanya, Sagar, and especially Srijan. They'll surely be there for you.

Don't get into bad things, okay? No alcohol, no beer or wine, no vapes, no nothing. Keep yourself pure and wise. You can achieve anything you can dream of. Just give up, Na Gara, and keep on going. Never suffer in silence, okay? There are always people who will listen and help you. 
Just don't get into bad stuff, okay? I know my Ritika has always been a good person with pure intentions. I believe that will surely continue. Don't forget, Dad, Mom, and your brother will always want the best for you, okay? Be strong and don't worry about your appearance or physicality, as I always say... You always had the best smile, eyes, and a perfect height. Pure Doraemon. Remember, never lower your self-esteem or set your worth according to other people's views or what they have. You are ranked by your determination and your courage. Kei kura ni sahera na basa hai? Share gara afno close ones haru lai. Be strong and always have patience. Mero ritika successful hunxa, she'll be a good girl like always vanne aas xa. 

I wish I had time to tell you more. Bhagya nai xaina ig. No worries, at atleast you are happy without me because you won't have to suffer many things, right? Chinta na leu, everything will be fine. Look, Ritika, I believe in you; you'll always be the best, the prettiest, and the most perfect one. I'll find no one like you, and that's a promise. That's all I can say to you. All the best, Ritika. And for the one last time...
I love you, baby; I always will.

I'm sorry, and please, if you'll think of me in the future, please forgive me. 

My prayers will always be there for you, promise. Seriously, I will never forget to mention you in my prayers. For your good health and well-being. And by the way, I'm sorry I have only watched 2 episodes of "When Life Gives You Tangerines" till now. Okay, Ritika. Bye! I love you, baby, forever.
