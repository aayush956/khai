Way beyond asking for forgiveness. Even God might not forgive us. But maybe the ones you hurt can forgive you by some chance, or is it not?

People don't stop chasing when the beauty is gone; people see that they're no longer good for each other with no future. And instead of hurting them, they choose to be away from them. Because they feel that leaving is what will give them freedom, that will be their stop to their suffering. Even if they suffer now, at least they won't have to later on even more. They are free from expecting things to change. They think that it would be so different if they were of the same kind. Or one allowed the other to stay the same and accept the way they are. Surely, lying did cause a great break in their heart, and that great mistake can never be changed now. They want you to eat well, be healthy, and never stop having faith. Most importantly, never stop being a good person no matter how shitty the world is. Never engage in negativity and bad company. Remember that even if they seemed quiet when you left them, like you were nothing, they knew what was best for you. They won't defend themselves anymore or care how you view them; they will surely carry a burden in their heart, but from the other side, they'll be happy that their loved one won't have to suffer any more in the future.

Learn to be happy and prioritize your mental health; stay strong and take good care of your family, especially your mother and father. Reach out to your friends, talk to them; not all of them are fake or untrustworthy. Accomplish your dreams and never stop working hard. Remember, constant practice and training can bring you out as the best, always. Never be lazy; work and give everything you have. Maybe in the future you'll find your same kind, and remember. Once God gives you signs that they're the one, love them the same way you loved before. In the future when you have no one, the old one will still be there if you have things to share to clear your mind. The old one will forever carry one guilt and shame for doing someone wrong. They can only ask for forgiveness. It is you who'll decide to view how bad or evil the old one is for causing you such harm. And maybe your friends will have an influence too. You know the old one very well, their nature and their responsibility. Take care, and at last, I love you. I always did, and I'll never forget you.
